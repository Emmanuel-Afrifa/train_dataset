#### I cleaned the data by performing the following tasks
- Creating a copy of the data
- Looking at th datatypes of the various columns
- Changing the datatype of the Row ID column since performing numerical operations on this column isn't meaningful
- Checking for null values
    - Only the Postal Code column has null values (Per our last discussion, we didn;t touch on handling missing data so I did not resolve this issue.)
- Checking for duplicates in the dataset
- Also, all the columns had the right encoding.
